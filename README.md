# Case Study – Robinhood, a US Based FinTech Brokerage Company

## Overview and Origin

Robinhood Markets is a U.S based fintech company that offers brokerage services through its website and mobile application. The fintech company was founded in 2013 by two Stanford classmates, Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. After graduating from Stanford, they moved to New York city and built two finance companies, selling their own trading software to hedge funds. There, they discovered that big Wall Street firms were paying fraction of a penny to trade stocks, while most customers were charged commission for every single trade. So, they decided to build a financial brokerage platform that would enable everyone access to financial markets.

Robinhood is a private company and has raised a total of $1.5B through 13 funding rounds. Its currently market evaluation is estimated at $20B, manages approx. $20B of assets, has 2031 employees generating a revenue of $270M in H1 2020.
